An HttpClient instance is a collection of settings applied to all requests executed by that instance. In addition, every HttpClient instance uses its own connection pool, isolating its requests from requests executed by other HttpClient instances
HttpClient has a richer and extensible type system for headers and content
HttpClient lets us write and plug in custom message handlers. This enables mocking in unit tests, and the creation of custom pipelines (for logging, compression, encryption, and so on)
